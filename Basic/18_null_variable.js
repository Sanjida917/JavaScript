let myname = null;
console.log(myname);

// In JavaScript, it shows that null is a object type variable. 
// But this is error because null is originally a null type variable.
// So null is object type - this is "Bug" or "Error in JavaScript"
console.log("Type Of null is : "+typeof myname);

//we can change the null variable
myname = "Sanjida Mahfuj";
